# Router
A simple PHP router.

This project was made inspired by [mrjgreen/phroute](https://github.com/mrjgreen/phroute) for routing, i really liked that repo, but i couldn't use composer in the project I was making, so i had to come up with something similar.
You are free to use this repository, yet if you want something more stable, more tested and with actual documentation I would recommend checking out mrjgreen repo first
